# **Wiseman Lab Repo for Image Correlation Techniques**

## Repo structure
This repo contains an `archive` with previous legacy versions of the code.
Newer and in-development code can be found in `current`.

## Guide
 - To suggest an extension or improvement, go to [Issues](https://github.com/Wiseman-Lab/image-correlation/issues) and create a new issue with the new features you would like to add. Please be as specific and clear as possible and if possible.
 - Suggest a **tag** which will be the name of the corresponding **branch**.
 - Each issue will result in a **branch** which is pretty much that: a branch of the central (**master**) code that differs slightly from it and where the new features suggested in the issues are being developed.
 - Once the new features have been added and tested, you can request the branch to be fused with the master by doing a **pull request**. The owner of the master (thus The Master) will revise the changes made and, if approved, he/she will pull them from the branch and merge them into the master.
 - If you want to try something out without any fear to cause chaos and destruction in the main code, creating a **branch** is the best way to go. You ca try stuff and if you screw up, don't worry, it's not the end of the world...for now.
 - If you are not part of the Wiseman Lab and you'd like to play around with the code or to contribute, you can **fork** the repo in your own GitHub space. By doing so you will have "your version of the code" that you can modify as you wish and if you want to contribute the changes you've made, you can create a **pull request**
