Use the pbsimulator() to generate a image series with particles which photobleach over time. 
In the simulator a tetramer has 4x the probability of bleaching as a monomer (however once the tetramer has bleached once it will be considered a trimer in the code). 
The density is currently arbitrary, so if you input 100,50 for densities then the first population will be twice as dense as the second.
There is no whitenoise currently.
